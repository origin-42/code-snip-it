Here is an application developed to work as a PWA offline, just in case the browser is down and you want to continue to work in your text editor and access it from anywhere with the same code once the device is back online. 

## Requirements

This application can be viewed and used inside the browser through the link below. Additionally, the application can be downloaded directly and installed as follows.

## Installation

Copy the URL for this repo, then from the command line

```
git clone {url}
```

Required Dependancies can be found via the package.json file through the client side and via the same file on the root directory.
. 
These can be installed once the application is downloaded.

Run;

```
npm init -y
npm i (installs dependancies) from the root directory
```

To run the application, use;

```
npm start
```

This will navigate to the client and install and subsequently begin the sever.
